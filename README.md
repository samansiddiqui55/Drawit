# Drawit - Gesture-Controlled Drawing with MediaPipe

**Drawit** is a futuristic, browser-based drawing tool that lets you draw and erase using only hand gestures — no mouse, pen, or touchscreen required!

Built with **MediaPipe Hands** and **JavaScript**, it turns your webcam into an interactive sketchpad where:

- ☝️ Your index finger draws
- ✊ A fist gesture erases
- ✍️ Live digital ink is projected on a black canvas
